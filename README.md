# Project: Analyze A/B Test Results

In this project, the goal was to analyze the results of an A/B test performed by an e-commerce site. The company developed a new web page in an attempt to increase sales. They set up the new page, along with control and treatment groups, where visitors were directed to the page corresponding to the group they were in, and recorded the results.

A Jupyter Notebook file was provided as a means to guide students through by asking questions that required the student to use knowledge gained in the 16 lessons preceding the project, along with knowledge of Python, NumPy, and pandas. I also used Matplotlib and Seaborn to enhance my analysis.

I analyzed the results of the A/B test using three different methods: probability, hypothesis testing, and regression testing. Each method is documented thoroughly and the results of each confirms the same outcome. Lastly, I summarized the results and provided a recommendation on what the company should do; implement the new page, keep the old page, or run the experiment for a longer period of time.
